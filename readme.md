Let's create a real heaven on Earth
========

It is 2019-12-29, I'm 46 years old and I decide to do something good for humanity before it's too late

I am a philosopher and may be the greatest ever. You will immediately have a question:

> What is the definition of `the greatest philosopher`

Here, it has these meanings:

- The greatest philosopher is the one who with the most free will
- The greatest philosopher has a deep understanding of science and is the greatest scientific philosopher
- The greatest philosopher knows how to create a real heaven on earth

Basically human beings have no free will
-----------

Now, new questions have arise, such as:

- What is free will
- Does woman/man have free will
- Heaven just exists in the story, how can it be possible to create a real heaven on earth

I must tell you a fact you may not know:

> Basically human beings have no free will

Not just human beings, all creatures only have very little free will

A person with free will means being free to do things in various ways, but people usually only do what most people are used to and what they are used to

> You thoughts and behaviors are not so different from those of other people in the world. Your environment and your past experience determine how your think and behave

I hope you understand it, it is just a simple philosophical question, not a difficult mathematical problem. My people must understand it, they will definitely understand it

Trump has relatively more free will compared to his political opponents
-------------

Let me give you an example. There is one person, most people know his name, that is, the current U.S. President Trump. Compared with his competitors, Trump has relatively more free will

Why do I say that Trump has relatively more free will? Because he does a lot of things differently, compared to his political opponents, he is special. If you hate him or love him, then you already know what makes him special

A person with more free will means that she/he is willing to do things that most people are not used to, or is willing to do things that she/he is not used to
-------------

Suppose there are two people with the same IQ called `Right` and `Left`. `Left` is willing to do things that most people are not used to, or willing to do things that he is not used to, then `Left` may find things that most people don't find, that is, `Left` may be smarter in some things

Now let `King Eca` come to a conclusion:

> If there is a heaven above the sky, then only those who like to do things in different ways have a chance to enter it, because only they have a chance to find it

King Eca is born for truth
---------------

But there is no heaven above the sky. The dead are really dead, no heaven or hell is waiting for the dead. The only way for anyone who wants to enter heaven is to follow King Eca to create the greatest country on earth, and I call `this greatest country` simply `heaven`

I have mentioned the word `greatest` many times in this book, and some people may not be used to it. I must be honest, I never wanted to be the greatest. If you want to learn math, you must be following a math book instead of trying to invent math yourself, I am the same as you

I was born for the truth. I tried for more than two decades to find a master worth following, unfortunately, I failed, I couldn't find a master with more free will. If there is no math book in the world and you have to learn math, then the only way is to invent math yourself, and then you will be the greatest mathematician

Three kinds of eternal life
----------------

Why `free will` is very important? because it has something to do with eternal life. I will introduce a way to be eternal life, and only those with more free will has the possibility to understand what I'm talking about

A new question arises: What is `eternal life`?

There are three kinds of `eternal life`

- Become `eternal life` after death

  I also call it `eternal life in dreams`. It exists in many religious stories

- Fake `eternal life`

  In the distant future, through biotechnology and medicine, it is possible for a person to survive for a long time. It is difficult to archive eternal life in this way, even if it does, it is some kind of cancer that will eventually be destroyed

- Connected `eternal life`

  This is the real eternal life. Wait! what is `Connected eternal life`? It has to do with space-time in physics. In physics, changes in space cause changes in time

  However, the space-time in physics is difficult to understand, it doesn't matter, you just follow me, I'm the greatest science philosopher ever, let us explore the mystery of eternal life together
