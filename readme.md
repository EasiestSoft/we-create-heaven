Basically humans have no free will
========

It is 2019-12-29, I'm 46 years old and I decided to do something good for humanity before it was too late

I am a philosopher and may be the greatest ever. You will immediately have a question:

> What is the definition of `the greatest philosopher`

Here, it has these meanings:

- The greatest philosopher is the one who with the most free will
- The greatest philosopher has a deep understanding of science and is the greatest scientific philosopher
- The greatest philosopher knows how to create a real heaven on earth

Basically human beings have no free will
-----------

You may have questions:

- What is free will
- Do humans have free will

I must tell you a fact you may not know:

> Basically human beings have no free will

Not just human beings, all creatures only have very little free will

A person with free will means being free to do things in various ways, but people usually only do what most people are used to and what they are used to

> You thoughts and behaviors are not so different from those of other people in the world. Your environment and your past experience determine how you think and behave

I hope you understand it, it is just a simple philosophical question, not a difficult mathematical problem. My people must understand it, they will definitely understand it

Since creatures have very little free will, to simplify the sentence, sometimes I will use statements such as `creatures have no free will`, and you should know that **it does not mean that creatures have absolutely no free will**

Trump has relatively more free will compared to his opponents
-------------

Let me give you an example. There is one person, most people know his name, that is, the current U.S. President Trump. Compared with his competitors, Trump has relatively a little more free will

Why do I say that Trump has relatively more free will? Because he does a lot of things differently, compared to his political opponents, he is special and smarter in some things. If you hate him or love him, then you already know what makes him special

If you want to raise a smarter daughter, it is best to encourage her to do anything differently. You will be happy for a very smart daughter, at the same time you must be mentally prepared, she will do things you are not used to and make you unhappy, and she may sometimes make mistakes. We can not ask someone to be smarter, but at the same time not to do things that others are not used to (that is, don't make others unhappy). If people understand this, Trump supporters will be more

Of course, doing anything different is not my goal, my goal is to find a better way in everything, once we find it we switch to it and so on...I call it Autonomous evolution of life

I know that human beings do not have free will, and only a small percentage of people have a little more free will who may understand what I am saying and are willing to follow me. If there is heaven above the sky, the gate of heaven is not open to everyone

How to find "Heaven"
---------

Suppose there are two people with the same IQ called `Right` and `Left`. `Left` is willing to do things that most people are not used to, and willing to do things that she is not used to, then `Left` may find things that most people don't find, that is, `Left` may be smarter in some things

Now let `King Eca` come to a conclusion:

> If there is a heaven above the sky, then only those who like to do things in different ways have a chance to enter it, because only they have a chance to find it

Creatures do not have free will: We can not find an example of autonomous evolution of creatures
-------------

The environment and past experience determine the behavior of creatures, so I don't think creatures have free will

If the creature has free will, the creature can do things that are not currently used to for a long-term evolutionary goal. For example, in order to evolve into humans millions of years later, orangutans are now actively practicing upright walking, and they have finally evolved into humans, but we have never observed such instances

All the facts we know today show that the evolution of creatures is determined by environment, the changed environment forces the creature to change their behaviors, causing them to evolve in time. This shows that **creatures have no free will in evolution**

**Evolution is the most important thing for all creatures** (although most people probably don't realized it, you know why), can you imagine that you still live like an orangutan? Creatures do not have free will in evolution, then **we can basically say that creatures do not have free will**, simply that **creatures do not have free will**. What I want to do is to create a country made up of people with free will, this is heaven on earth

King Eca is born for truth
---------------

There is no heaven above the sky. The dead are really dead, no heaven or hell is waiting for the dead. The only way for anyone who wants to enter heaven is to follow King Eca to create the greatest country on earth, and I call `this greatest country` simply `heaven`

I have mentioned the word `greatest` many times in this book, and some people may not be used to it. I must be honest, I never wanted to be the greatest. If you want to learn math, you must be following a math book instead of trying to invent math yourself, I am the same as you

I am born for truth. I tried for more than two decades to find a master worth following, unfortunately, I failed, I couldn't find a master with more free will. If there is no math book in the world and you have to learn math, then the only way is to invent math yourself, and then you will be the greatest mathematician

Three kinds of "eternal life"
----------------

Why `free will` is very important? because it has something to do with eternal life. I will introduce a way to be eternal life, and only those with more free will has the possibility to understand what I'm talking about

A new question arises: What is `eternal life`?

There are three kinds of `eternal life`

- Become `eternal life` after death

  I also call it `eternal life in dreams`. It exists in many religious stories

- Fake `eternal life`

  In the distant future, through biotechnology and medicine, it is possible for a person to survive for a long time. It is difficult to archive eternal life in this way, even if it does, it is some kind of cancer that will eventually be destroyed

- Connected `eternal life`

  This is the real eternal life. Wait...what is `Connected eternal life`? It has to do with space-time in physics. In physics, changes in space cause changes in time

  However, the space-time in physics is difficult to understand, it doesn't matter, you just follow me, I'm the greatest science philosopher ever, let us explore the mystery of eternal life together
