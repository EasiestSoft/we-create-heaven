My name is King Eca, I'm 46 years old and I decided to do something good for humanity before it was too late

King Eca is born for truth
---------------

There is no heaven above the sky. The dead are really dead, no heaven or hell is waiting for the dead. The only way for anyone who wants to enter heaven is to follow King Eca to create the greatest country on earth, and I call `this greatest country` simply `heaven`

I am born for truth. I tried for more than two decades to find a master worth following, unfortunately, I failed, I couldn't find a master with more free will. If there is no math book in the world and you have to learn math, then the only way is to invent math yourself, and then you will be the greatest mathematician

Three kinds of "eternal life"
----------------

Why [free will](https://easiestsoft.com/we-create-heaven/humans-have-very-little-free-will.html) is very important? because it has something to do with eternal life. I will introduce a way to be eternal life, and only those with more free will has the possibility to understand what I'm talking about

A new question arises: What is `eternal life`?

There are three kinds of `eternal life`

- Become `eternal life` after death

  I also call it `eternal life in dreams`. It exists in many religious stories

- Fake `eternal life`

  In the distant future, through biotechnology and medicine, it is possible for a person to survive for a long time. It is difficult to archive eternal life in this way, even if it does, it is some kind of cancer that will eventually be destroyed

- [Connected eternal life](./humans-have-no-free-will-but-the-universe-has.md)

  This is the real eternal life. Wait...what is `Connected eternal life`? It has to do with space-time in physics. In physics, changes in space cause changes in time

  However, the space-time in physics is difficult to understand, it doesn't matter, you just follow me, <!--I'm the greatest science philosopher ever, --> let us explore the mystery of eternal life together
