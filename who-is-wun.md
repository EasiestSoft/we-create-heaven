Who is Wun
=====

God is the universe, and the universe is God

`Wun` is the name of God

Why did King Eca rename God to `Wun`?

Whose God is it
-----------

I have read some popular science books written by scientists, the author may mention God in his book, this brings up a question: Whose God is it, is it the author's God or the reader's God? A devout religious believer may prefer this scientist to believe in his God

I have heard the following from religious believers many times:

- 99% of scientists believe in God
- Newton believes in God
- Einstein believes in God
- Darwin believes in God
- ...

What they will never understand or don't want to understand is that Newton's God may not be their God, and Newton's God may fight their God

Two types of God
------------

Basically, humans do not have free will, and their environment and past experience determine their thinking and behavior

Everyone has a different environment and past experience, so everyone has their own God, different from others. Once I mention the word `God`, they immediately think of their God (of course, this God has very little free will) and I have no way to stop them from thinking like that, the only solution is I give God a new name, this new God has strong free will, it is the real God

The real God is called `Wun`

Some properties of Wun
-------------

- Wun is everything

  If someone says that Wun looks like a human, it is totally wrong

  Since Wun is everything, it cannot be said that Wun looks like a specific thing

- We are part of Wun

  `Where is Wun` is a meaningless word because you are already part of Wun

  No longer need to pray to Wun, but if you want to talk to yourself, you can still do it

- No heaven, No hell

  Since we are part of Wun, if we die we should die, there is no heaven/hell waiting for the dead

- We create heaven on Earth

  Since we are part of Wun, if we create heaven on Earth, it is true heaven

**We must hurry up, we have only one life, this is our only chance**, if you are reading this article and are interested in  doing something meaningful, then you must act now
